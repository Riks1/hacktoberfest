## Introduction

[GitHub](https://github.com) is a platform that allows developers to store, track, share, and collaborate on code. It's a big way to display your technical projects and progress through repositories (a space for project code), with companies and recruiters often asking for links to your GitHub when you apply to jobs. It‚Äôs one of the best ways for them to see what you‚Äôve actually built, not just what you‚Äôve written on your resume. üêô

But did you know that there's a way to personalize your GitHub to make your personality stand out?!

It's a profile README! This is my README for example. üë§

A **README file** is a file in a code repository that tells others about your project, like an introduction. It can explain what a project does, setup information, and credits the project's contributors. 

It is named **README.md** (the **.md** stands for Markdown, a lightweight language to format text).

In this project tutorial, we're going to make a **profile** README ‚Äì a file that tells others about YOU! It's the first thing that people see on your GitHub. Think of your profile README as an "About Me" on a website. 

Let's get started.

## Making the Profile README

Make sure you have a GitHub account before we get started! You can [create one here](https://github.com/signup) if you don't have one.

Then, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you're signed into GitHub.
2. Find the + button in the upper right corner of the header, and then click "New repository".
3. You'll be prompted to write a repository name. Make this exactly your GitHub username. For example, if your username is `codedex_user`, name your repository `codedex_user`.
4. Make sure the repository is set to "Public".
5. Select initialize this repository with a README. Click the [Create repository] button.

## Editing the README

Now that we have a blank **README.md** file, we're going to add your information. 

Some things you can highlight:

- üë§ Blurb about yourself
- üè´ Your school, major, and graduation year
- üíº Club, internship, and work experience
- üèÜ Your proudest accomplishments
- üßÉ Fun fact about yourself
- ‚ûï Anything you want!

Again, READMEs are primarily written with **Markdown** ‚Äì it's a simple language to format plain text and turn it into things like headers, formatted text (bold, italics, underlines), lists, or links!

Here's a quick guide on how to mark down your text:

### Headers

You can kick off the file with a H1 heading with a single `#`:

```markdown
# Hello, World! üåé I'm Gabby üëã
```

### Text Formatting

Create emphasis in text with:

- `_italicize_`
- `**bold**`
- `~~strikethrough~~`

### Lists

Put an asterisk (`*`), dash (`-`), or number (`1.`) before each list item. Each option creates bullet points, dashed lists, and numbered lists, respectively. For example:

```markdown
currently:
- üëæ curriculum @ marketing @ cod√©dex
- üé® graphic information technlogoy @ arizona state
- üèÜ MLH Top 50!
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è hackNY '25
```

### Links

```markdown
(Google)[https://google.com]
```

### Images

```markdown
![cute cat](https://images.com/cat_img.PNG)
```

### Highlighting Code

Inline code:

```markdown
Here's a `<html>` tag.
```

Code blocks:

```
\`\`\`html
asdfasdf
\`\`\`
```

## Personalizing the README

There are many plugins and ways to personalize your README!

- Images that show a glimpse into what you do, or style the README!
- Emojis
- SVGs (Vector images)
- Here‚Äôs a [superlist](https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme?tab=readme-ov-file#tools) of things you can embed ‚Äì everything from stats on what languages you use, visitor counters, jokes, or even music players!

## #30NitesOfCode Pet Embed

If you are participating in [#30NitesOfCode](https://www.codedex.io/30-nites-of-code), add your pet to your GitHub README as well!

## Examples for Inspo

Here are some from my friends:

Heldanna has a timeline of her job experience in a table!

Grace has a lot of links attached with a nice colored block + logo attached to each link!

Kailey has some cards with stats from her repositories!

## Conclusion

You now have your very own README on your profile! We‚Äôd love to see what you‚Äôve made ‚Äì drop your creations on Cod√©dex Discord, Cod√©dex OPC, or Twitter/X.
