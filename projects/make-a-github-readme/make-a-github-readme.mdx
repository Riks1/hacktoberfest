## Introduction

[GitHub](https://github.com) is a platform that allows developers to store, track, share, and collaborate on code. It's a big way to display your technical projects and progress through repositories (a space for project code), with companies often asking for links to your GitHub when you apply to jobs.

This is my README!

Did you know that there's actually a way to personalize your GitHub to make your personality stand out? In this tutorial, we're going to make a README file about you that's displayed on your profile!

## What's a README file?

A **README file** is a file in a project repository that tells others about your project. It can explain what a project does, setup information, and credits the projects contributors.

In this tutorial, we'll be making a **profile** README - a file that tells others about YOU! Think of your profile README as an about me page on a website. 

[Example]

Make sure you have a GitHub account before we get started! You can create one [here](https://github.com/signup) if you don't have one.

## Making the profile README

1. Make sure you're signed into GitHub.
2. Find the + button in the upper right corner of the header, and then click **New Repository**.
3. You'll be prompted to write a name for your repository. Make this your GitHub username. For example, if your username is `codedex_user`, name your repository `codedex_user`.
4. Select initialize this repository with a README.
5. Make sure the repository is set to **public**. Click **Create repository**.

## Editing the README

Now we're going to add your information to the file. Some things you can highlight:

- Your school, major, and graduation year
- Club, internship, and work experience
- Your proudest accomplishments
- Links to external sites or social media pages
- Anything you want!

READMEs are primarily written with **markdown** - it's a way to format plain text and turn it into things like headers, formatted text (bold, italics, underlines), lists, or links!

Here's a quick guide on how to mark down your text:

- **Headers:** `# Header 1` (add more #s to get smaller headers) 
- **Links:** `(Google)[https://google.com]`
- **Images:** `![](https://images.com/cat_img.PNG)`
- **Highlighting code:** ````<script> //code here </script>````
- **Lists:** Put an asterisk (*), dash (-), or number (1.) before each list item. Each option creates bullet points, dashed lists, and numbered lists, respectively.

## Personalizing the README

There are many plugins and ways to personalize your README!

- Images that show a glimpse into what you do, or style the README!
- Emojis
- SVGs (Vector images)
- Here’s a [superlist](https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme?tab=readme-ov-file#tools) of things you can embed - everything from stats on what languages you use, visitor counters, jokes, or even music players!

## Examples for inspo

Here are some from my friends:

Heldanna has a timeline of her job experience in a table!

Grace has a lot of links attached with a nice colored block + logo attached to each link!

Kailey has some cards with stats from her repositories!

## Conclusion

You now have your very own README on your profile! We’d love to see what you’ve made - drop your creations on Discord or Codédex OPC.
