## Introduction

[GitHub](https://github.com) is a platform that allows developers to store, track, share, and collaborate on code. It's a big way to display your technical projects and progress through repositories (a space for project code), with companies and recruiters often asking for links to your GitHub when you apply to jobs. It’s one of the best ways for them to see what you’ve actually built, not just what you’ve written on your resume.

But did you know that there's a way to personalize your GitHub to make your personality stand out? 

It's a profile README! This is my README for example:

A **README file** is a file in a code repository that tells others about your project, like an introduction. It can explain what a project does, setup information, and credits the project's contributors. 

It usually lives in the root folder of a project and is named **README.md** (the **.md** stands for Markdown, a lightweight way to format text).

In this project tutorial, we're going to make a **profile** README – a file that tells others about YOU! Think of your profile README as an "About Me" page on a website. 

Let's get started.

## Making the Profile README

Make sure you have a GitHub account before we get started! You can [create one here](https://github.com/signup) if you don't have one.

1. Make sure you're signed into GitHub.
2. Find the + button in the upper right corner of the header, and then click "New repository".
3. You'll be prompted to write a repository name. Make this exactly your GitHub username. For example, if your username is `codedex_user`, name your repository `codedex_user`.
4. Make sure the repository is set to "Public".
5. Select initialize this repository with a README. Click the [Create repository] button.

## Editing the README

Now that we have a blank **README.md** file, we're going to add your information. 

Some things you can highlight:

- Your school, major, and graduation year
- Club, internship, and work experience
- Your proudest accomplishments
- Fun fact about yourself
- Anything you want!

READMEs are primarily written with **Markdown** - it's a way to format plain text and turn it into things like headers, formatted text (bold, italics, underlines), lists, or links!

Here's a quick guide on how to mark down your text:

- **Headers:** `# Header 1` (add more #s to get smaller headers) 
- **Links:** `(Google)[https://google.com]`
- **Images:** `![](https://images.com/cat_img.PNG)`
- **Highlighting code:** ````<script> //code here </script>````
- **Lists:** Put an asterisk (*), dash (-), or number (1.) before each list item. Each option creates bullet points, dashed lists, and numbered lists, respectively.

## Personalizing the README

There are many plugins and ways to personalize your README!

- Images that show a glimpse into what you do, or style the README!
- Emojis
- SVGs (Vector images)
- Here’s a [superlist](https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme?tab=readme-ov-file#tools) of things you can embed - everything from stats on what languages you use, visitor counters, jokes, or even music players!

## Examples for inspo

Here are some from my friends:

Heldanna has a timeline of her job experience in a table!

Grace has a lot of links attached with a nice colored block + logo attached to each link!

Kailey has some cards with stats from her repositories!

## Conclusion

You now have your very own README on your profile! We’d love to see what you’ve made - drop your creations on Discord or Codédex OPC.
